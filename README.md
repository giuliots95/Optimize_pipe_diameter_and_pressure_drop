# Optimize_pipe_diameter_and_pressure_drop
%
% CONTENT
% This script solves the problem of finding the optimal diameter for a
% straight pipe coneying an incompressible fluid, for different mass flow 
% rates. 
% The best design solution is considered the one that minimizes both 
% the pressure drop per unitary pipe length and the pipe diameter.
% 
% DESIGN VARIABLE 
% There is 1 design variable (the pipe diameter) and 2
% competitive objectives, so the problem is solved with the Pareto-optimum
% approach, that will output a compromise solution.
%
% The user can express both lower and upper boundaries for the search of
% the optimal pipe diameter and can provide lower and upper boundary for
% the flow velocity [m/s], thus constraining the optimization problem.
%
% PROBLEM CONSTANTS
% To perform the optimization, some fluid properties such as fluid dynamic 
% viscosity and density shall be imposed. The rated mass flow rate to be
% conveyed by the pipe and the pipe absolute roughness (that depends from
% the pipe material and conditions) shall be given as constant inputs.
%
% SOLVER CHOICE
% Non dominated configurations are found with the multi-objective genetic 
% algorithm solver "gamultiobj", but other algorithms such as 
% "paretosearch" can be used, editing the solver section.
%
% Note that both multi-objective solvers do not support inter variables as
% default, while "ga" solver enables also mixed-integer problems, but was
% conceived for mono-objective optimization only. One could also define a
% scalar overall cost function, like [1], but the purpose of this study is
% to consider the 2 objectives strictly separated.
%
% HOW IT WORKS
% For each mass flow rate, the program calculates non-dominated designs in 
% terms of pipe diameter [m] and pressure drop per meter [mm H20/m]. 
% The best solution is chosen with the TOPSIS method. 
% For a closer look on this outranking method, a good explanation is
% provided by [2]. Since there are only 2 objectives, I chose to assignan
% equal weight to each one, thinking that they have the same importance.
% The user is free to change the weights when calling the topsis.m
% function. For example, one could assign w=[0.25, 0.75] to make the
% diameter objective more relevant.
% 
% Finally, the best design for each flow rate is represented in the "pipe
% chart", that the log-log chart commonly used by technicians to speed up
% pipelines sizing.
